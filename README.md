A tool for rusty shell scripts.

A thin command line interface for [dialoguer](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/dialoguer), heavily inspired by [gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum).

This project not only tries to implement the functionality of [gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum) in rust but also aims to extend it. An example of the extended functionality is the multi selection option on the `filter` subcommand.
